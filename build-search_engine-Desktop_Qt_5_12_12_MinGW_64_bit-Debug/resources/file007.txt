The next generation takes the helm
“Filipino American history is American history,” says Allan Bergano, who with his wife, Edwina, opened the first Filipino-owned dental practice in the area in 1983. The couple worked on an oral history project about local naval families in their spare time. “It’s our duty to capture this overlooked history for future generations.”

Everywhere there are signs of the next generation taking the helm. At Angie’s Bakery, Ken Garcia Olaes has taken over his uncle’s bakery—during a pandemic, no less—and given the 32-year-old business a buzz of energy and a designer’s aesthetic. As head baker, Olaes creates everything from spiralled brioches (ensaymada) to traditional rolls (pandesal). His hand-crafted ube lattes (flavored with purple yam) are a cult favorite. “I’m an artist even when I’m not sketching,” he says. “And it’s not just what comes out of the oven. It’s about the entire sensory experience, from the aroma when you enter to the way our products are displayed.”

In another Virginia Beach strip mall just south of the Naval Air Station Oceana, Emma Dizon is prepping for the Sunday brunch rush at her restaurant, Only at Renee’s. While I wait for my to-go order, she presents me with a speckled blue plate lined with a square-cut banana leaf on which five perfectly rolled lumpia sit.

“I want to make street food look as good as it tastes,” says the Fashion Institute of Technology graduate and New York City transplant. She uses fresh ingredients—and her grandmother’s recipes. “We make everything by hand here, except for the longganisa [sausage], which my father makes in New York and brings to me,” says Dizon. “Making food with love is what I saw in my grandmother’s restaurant in Pampanga, and my mother’s restaurant in Queens.”

And now here it is in Virginia Beach. A culture captured in a lumpia roll: well-adapted to various environments, its essence unchanged
